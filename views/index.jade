        p At Sun Spirits we do things a little bit differently. We take used wine grapes and recycle them by extracting the leftover alcohol.

        p Once the alcohol has been extracted, it is distilled into vodka using the sunâ€™s natural heat. After the distillation takes place, the vodka is diluted using natural pure water and bottled into our containers made completely from recycled material.
        br
        br
        p Our commitment to recycling and local communities is continued by donating the leftover grapes to local farmers for animal feed.
