        p At Sun Spirits we do things a little bit differently. We take used wine grapes and recycle them by extracting the leftover alcohol. Once the alcohol has been extracted, it is distilled into vodka using the sunâ€™s natural heat. After the distillation takes place, the vodka diluted using natural pure water and bottled into our containers made completely from recycled material. Our commitment to recycling and local communities is continued by donating the leftover grapes to local farmers for animal feed.
